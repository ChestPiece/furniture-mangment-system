# Payload Blank Template

This template comes configured with the bare minimum to get started on anything you need.

## Quick start

This template can be deployed directly from our Cloud hosting and it will setup MongoDB and cloud S3 object storage for media.

## Quick Start - local setup

To spin up this template locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

After you click the `Deploy` button above, you'll want to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
2. `cd my-project && cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables. You'll need to add the `MONGODB_URL` from your Cloud project to your `.env` if you want to use S3 storage and the MongoDB database that was created for you.

3. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
4. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.

#### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker for local development instead of a local MongoDB instance, the provided docker-compose.yml file can be used.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Modify the `MONGODB_URL` in your `.env` file to `mongodb://127.0.0.1/<dbname>`
- Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file's `MONGODB_URL` to match the above `<dbname>`
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the database, optionally pass `-d` to run in the background.

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

## Theming System

The application uses a semantic theming system built with Tailwind CSS variables. The colors are defined in \`src/app/(frontend)/styles.css\` and mapped in \`tailwind.config.ts\`.

### Status Colors

- **Success**: \`bg-success\`, \`text-success-foreground\` (Green) - Used for 'Paid' status, 'Delivered' orders.
- **Warning**: \`bg-warning\`, \`text-warning-foreground\` (Yellow) - Used for 'Pending' orders.
- **Info**: \`bg-info\`, \`text-info-foreground\` (Blue) - Used for 'In Progress' orders.
- **Destructive**: \`bg-destructive\`, \`text-destructive-foreground\` (Red) - Used for 'Due Amount', errors.

To modify these colors, edit the CSS variables in \`src/app/(frontend)/styles.css\`.

## Development

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: \`npm run test:int\` (Vitest)
- **E2E Tests**: \`npm run test:e2e\` (Playwright)

### Database

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or configured via \`DATABASE_URL\`.
